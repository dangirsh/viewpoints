Step 0: Install Docker CE for your platform if you don't already have it: https://www.docker.com/get-docker


Step 1: Build the Viewpoints docker image. Run:

> docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t viewpoints .

from the base project directory. This will likely take several minutes the first time. If you change the source, be sure to re-run this command for your changes to be reflected in the Docker image.


Step 2: Run Viewpoints, swapping "./docker_vp.sh" for "./vp". You can pass any arguments accepted by vp. For example:

> ./docker_vp.sh --help  # Prints help message in container, then quits.

> ./docker_vp.sh -d , inline_skating.csv  # Opens Viewpoints with example dataset in the container.



Exiting Viewpoints will automatically exit the container.
